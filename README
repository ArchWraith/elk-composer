WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS

STEP 1: SETUP
- copy the "elk-composer" folder off of the dvd and continue these steps from there. Attempting to run these steps from the dvd may not work

STEP 2: ENABLE WSL 2
- wsl is only available on windows 10 & 11, older systems will need to use hypervisor
- wsl is already installed on most windows 10 systems, but version 2 must be enabled
- Docker does not work without wsl 2 so that needs to be installed and enabled on the host machine
- wsl 2 can be enabled with this command "wsl --set-default-version 2"

STEP 3: INSTALL DOCKER
- if you have internet access, it is recommended that the latest version of the docker installer be downloaded from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
- if you do not have internet access, use the installer that is provided. "Docker Desktop Installer.exe"
- restart the system

STEP 4: LOAD THE ELK STACK IMAGES
- run the "load_images.bat" script to load the images into your docker instance

STEP 5: LOAD THE PIPELINE
- coming soon

STEP 6: DOCKER COMPOSE
- run "compose.bat" from the terminal
- closing the shell that pops up will not close the elk stack. "down.bat" should be run to close and remove the containers
- to view logs, run "logs.bat"

ADDITIONAL INFO
- once all steps are completed, the kibana interface can be accessed through a browser at http://localhost:5601
- if no files are loaded into the pipeline, the logstash container will close automatically
